The JIRA Cloud REST API Reference is at
https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/cloud/.

Links to all JIRA APIs are provided at
https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/jira-apis.

To get started building JQL queries start with the Basic Search in the
JIRA web page, selecting menu items from the drop-down, etc.  Then
switch to the Advanced mode which shows the underlying JIRA query
which can be fine tuned further.  Some documentation on JQL is at
https://www.atlassian.com/blog/jira-software/jql-the-most-flexible-way-to-search-jira-14.
