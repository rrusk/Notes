0) Install monit in Ubuntu 12.04 using:

$ sudo apt-get install monit

1) Get help on monit

$ monit -h

or

$ man monit

2) Configure monit in /etc/default/monit, /etc/monit/monitrc
Add to /etc/monit/monitrc these lines:

# needed so that monit command-line tools will work
set httpd port 2812 and
use address localhost
allow localhost

3) Setup services to monitor by adding scripts to /etc/monit/conf.d

For instance, an autossh monit script for setting up reverse ssh service
might look like this:

# Monitor autossh_admin
check process autossh_admin with pidfile /usr/local/reverse_ssh/autossh_admin.pid
    start program = "/usr/local/reverse_ssh/bin/start_admin_tunnel.sh"
    stop program = "/usr/local/reverse_ssh/bin/stop_admin_tunnel.sh"
    if 100 restarts within 100 cycles then timeout

4) Start monit with

$ sudo /etc/init.d/monit start

5) Check services using

$ sudo monit summary
$ sudo monit status

6) Start monitoring a service that isn't currently being monitored
and has been setup in /etc/monit/conf.d/service2run

$ sudo monit monitor service2run

7) Use /var/log/monit.log to troubleshoot monit.

8) To unmonitor a service:

$ sudo monit unmonitor service2run

9) To start a service

$ sudo monit start service2run
