From https://askubuntu.com/questions/745218/ubuntu-wont-boot-because-of-lvmetad#:~:text=The%20Failed%20to%20connect%20to,some%20unneeded%20files%2C%20and%20reboot.&text=These%20are%20the%20commands%20that,booting%20from%20the%20USB%20drive.

The Failed to connect to lvmetad error can happen because the disk is
100% full. To fix this, boot from a USB thumb drive, mount the full
disk, delete some unneeded files, and reboot. I also reinstalled the
boot system - I don't know if that is necessary or not.

These are the commands that resolved the problem for me, run from a
terminal after booting from the USB drive. I have stock Ubuntu 18.04
with full-drive encryption. YMMV.

1. Mount the drive:

sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda5 sda5_crypt
sudo vgscan --mknodes
sudo vgchange -ay
sudo mount /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root /mnt

2. Delete unneeded files (cd /mnt/home/your_username ... rm ...)

3. (may not be necessary) reinstall the boot system:

cd /mnt/
sudo mount /dev/sda1 boot
for d in dev sys proc run; do sudo mount --bind /$d $d; done
sudo vi etc/crypttab # make sure first line uses "sda5_crypt"
sudo chroot .
update-grub
grub-install /dev/sda
update-initramfs -u -k all
exit
sudo umount dev sys proc run boot

4. Unmount:

cd /
sudo umount /mnt
sudo vgchange -an
sudo cryptsetup close sda5_crypt

5. Reboot:

sudo reboot
