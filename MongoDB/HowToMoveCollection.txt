From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11554762/how-can-i-copy-collection-to-another-database-in-mongodb

The best way is to do a mongodump then mongorestore.

You can select the collection via:

mongodump -d some_database -c some_collection

Then restore it:

mongorestore -d some_other_db -c some_or_other_collection dump/some_collection.bson

Existing data in some_or_other_collection will be preserved. That way
you can "append" a collection from one database to another.

Prior to version 2.4.3, you will also need to add back your indexes
after you copy over your data. Starting with 2.4.3, this process is
automatic, and you can disable it with --noIndexRestore.
