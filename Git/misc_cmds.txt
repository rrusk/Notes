Add remote repository:

$git remote add upstream git://git.code.sf.net/p/oscarmcmaster/oscar

To pull from this repository to master:

$ git pull upstream master

To move files between NTFS and Unix disks, this allows differences
due to file permissions to be surpressed: (From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1580596/how-do-i-make-git-ignore-mode-changes-chmod)

git config core.fileMode false

From git-config(1):

       core.fileMode
           If false, the executable bit differences between the index and the
           working copy are ignored; useful on broken filesystems like FAT.
           See git-update-index(1). True by default.

The -c flag can be used to set this option for one-off commands:

git -c core.fileMode=false diff
