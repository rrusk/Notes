You need to copy the repo to your git-hub and work on it for that follow the steps:

Create a new repository in your github

Then clone the repository which you need to work on from your hosted.org to the local machine

Then rename the repo with upstream using:

    git remote rename origin upstream 

Then add your repository url to your remote using: 

    git remote add origin <url>

Then push the changes to your remote repo using: 

    git push origin master

From the above steps, you can copy repo to your github. 

To get updated and to pull the changes you can do:

    git pull upstream master && git push origin master

This will pull the changes and keep you updated with your official repo.
