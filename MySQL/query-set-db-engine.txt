According to MySQL 5.5 documentation at
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/storage-engine-setting.html the
default database engine is InnoDB as of MySQL 5.5.5 and MyISAM before
5.5.5.

Jan 2014 versions of Ubuntu 12.04.3 server edition installs MySQL
5.5.34.

To check the db engine used in tables of the `oscar_test` database:

> SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM `oscar_test`;

To change from the default InnoDB to MyISAM (which doesn't honor
foreign key constraints) add 'default-storage-engine = myisam' to the
[mysqld] block of /etc/mysql/my.cnf
