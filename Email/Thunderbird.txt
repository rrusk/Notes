To stop getting warning about less secure apps:

I had this issue today after the "less secure apps" thing from Google. To fix the issue is simple and also keep your access more safe.

1. Turn off "less secure apps" and remove Thinderbird from your Google security settings.

2. Open Thunderbird, select your email account on the left and go Tools > Account Settings (just ignore any issues with login and passwords for now)

3. Go to Server > Authentication Method and select OAuth2.

4. Down the left, go to Outgoing Server (SMTP), on the right panel you should see "Google Mail (Default)", click Edit, on "Authentication Method" select OAuth2

5. Click OK to go back to main window.

6. Click on "Receive Messages", Thunderbird will show up a Google authentication window, fill in your email and password.

7. Done!

This is done only once, now you have a more secure access back to Gmail.
